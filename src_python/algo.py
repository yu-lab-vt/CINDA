# Assuming we have n detections in the video, then
# detection_arcs: a n x 4 matrix, each row corresponds to a detection in the
# form of [detection_id, C_i, C_i^en, C_i^ex];
# transition_arcs: a m x 3 matrix, each row corresponds to a transition arc
# in the form of [detection_id_i, detection_id_j, C_i,j]
# NOTE that the id should be unique and in the range of 1 to n. Detailed 
# defintion can be found in section 3 of the reference:

# OUTPUT:
# traj: cells containing the linking results; each cell contains a
# set of ordered detection ids, which indicate a trajectory
